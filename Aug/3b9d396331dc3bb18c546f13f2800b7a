Johannesburg - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane lambasted management’s conduct and the treatment of nurses at the Dr George Mukhari Hospital in Tshwane following complaints about working conditions published in the Sunday Independent last week.Mkhwebane and her deputy visited the hospital this week following a report in the paper detailing complaints by the nurses working in the Covid-19 wards.According to sources at the hospital, Mkhwebane was baffled by advertisements of permanent posts at the facility while nurses were still waiting for their Covid-19 short-term contracts.“They were asked why they were advertising permanent posts instead of absorbing the nurses that were on the Covid contracts.“They also questioned why the hospital was not paying the nurses a risk allowance as they continue to put their lives in danger,” said a nurse speaking on condition of anonymity.The nurses said management appeared to be shaken as now they were promised payment would be made by month-end and their contracts would be resolved.They said the nurse who collapsed and contracted the virus was treated in a better way.“She has now been placed in the nurse’s quarters and is receiving better treatment,” said the nurse.Mkhwebane’s spokesperson, Oupa Segalwe said the visit was part of the office’s nationwide tour to investigate working conditions that may affect the effective delivery of services.They are also checking if the facilities are coping with the demand for services and whether they are adequately resourced to treat patients, especially in these Covid-19 times.“The issues are common across the hospitals. They include alleged inadequate PPE, critical positions that are not filled and delays in the procurement of critical supplies due to red tape. Detailed information will come out in reports which will be prepared and made public. However, the affected organs of state will be given an opportunity to comment on the draft findings and/or observations,” he said.Segalwe added that where shortcomings are found and observed, Mkhwebane would take remedial action while holding those responsible to account. The Gauteng Department of Health last week committed to pay the nurses by month-end.Acting Health MEC Jacob Mamabolo has directed the department to compile a consolidated report on Covid-19 HR-related issues at all facilities to ensure health-care workers are not inconvenienced any further.Sunday Independent
