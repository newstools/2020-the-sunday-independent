Johannesburg - The four-ton truck that has been standing stationary for years at the notorious Hillbrow flats in Eldorado Park now serves as a painful reminder of the brutal death of 16-year-old Nathaniel “Lokkie” Julies, who was allegedly shot dead by a police officer on Wednesday evening.The white truck, with deflated tyres and dirty windows, carries Nathaniel’s hand marks on the side, prints he left right after he was allegedly shot by the police. An incident that shook the whole of South Africa and triggered protests and unrest in the community whose members are calling out for justice for Nathaniel, who has Down Syndrome.Three days after the fatal incident that once more puts a spotlight on police brutality, the main road in Eldos had been blockaded with tyres and rocks.Children and adults yesterday were shouting and brandishing placards with “coloured lives matter”, saying they are a forgotten and bullied community.Two police officers were arrested on Friday for the boy’s murder.“The pair will be charged with murder and possibly defeating the ends of justice. The two South African Police Service members are attached to the Eldorado Park crime prevention unit,” said Independent Police Investigative Directorate spokesperson, Ndileka Cola.On Friday Police Minister Bheki Cele went to the family to offer his condolences but was met by chants and an angry community that told him he was not trusted because of police corruption. He promised that the matter would be fully investigated and that the law would take its cause.Eldorado Park residents protest outside the police station following the death of 16-year-old Nathaniel Julies, who was allegedly shot by police.

They killed a young boy who meant no harm to anyone, especially because we all know Nathaniel and his condition. It was like these two police officers were hungry for blood and were looking for trouble," she alleged.Eldorado Park teen Nathaniel Julius was allegedly shot by police on Wednesday.

Instead, when they arrest a criminal whose absence within the community guarantees our safety, right the following day we will see the very person roaming the streets. How then are you supposed to trust them?” The police are very useless and are a threat to the very community they are meant to protect,” said Mckenzie.Another community elder Joseph Human said it was high time the police got replaced with dedicated civil servants. “The image that people have of us is not accurate. Yes we have our own challenges, but which township doesn’t?”Community pastor and leader Dwain Ponsonby said there had always been a feud between the police and the community because of corruption, extortion, abuse of authority and preferential treatment towards a criminal over an upstanding citizen.And although the community is a great one, it is marred by issues like unemployment and crime and the government should invest in solving.“The implicated officer is a bully and what’s scary about this is that we don’t know if it’ll happen again or not. We have children living here and need a partnership that helps protect them,” said Ponsonby.A silent sit down in honour of Nathaniel will take place on Sunday at 3pm along the main road in Eldorado Park.The Sunday Independent
