Cape Town - President Cyril Ramaphosa is delivering his fourth State of the Nation Address (SONA) in the National Assembly on Thursday evening. The theme for this year’s SONA is "Following up on our commitments: making your future work better." South Africans are expected to hear Ramaphosa reflect on a wide range of political, economic and social matters, with corruption and unemployment being on the top of his agenda. The event is presided over by Speaker Thandi Modise and/or the Chairperson of the Council. Earlier this week, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has threatened to disrupt the address if Ramaphosa does not fire Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan. The party on Wednesday detailed 10 reasons why the former finance minister should be fired from Ramaphosa's cabinet. But Modise said she hoped for no disruptions. "We hope that SONA will be peaceful, that everything will go according to plan and that it will start and finish on time. We do hope that all of us will respect the rules of the House and that we will not have any disruption".   * Catch all the latest SONA news on our #SONA2020 trend page.
