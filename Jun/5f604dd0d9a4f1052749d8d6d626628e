Johannesburg - Joburg metro police have arrested five people who were hosting a party and drinking in public in Malvern on Tuesday night. 
Senior Superintendent Wayne Minaar, a spokesperson for the Joburg Metro Police Department (JMPD), said the group had been singing, dancing and braaing along the road when police received a complaint at about 7pm. 
He said some managed to escape, but the police arrested five people and have charged them with contravening the National Disaster Management Act. 
Under current lockdown regulations, members of the public are allowed to purchase and transport alcohol, but are only allowed to consume it at home.
