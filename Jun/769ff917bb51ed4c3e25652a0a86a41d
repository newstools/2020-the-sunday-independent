Johannesburg - Gauteng’s active Covid-19 cases have doubled in the space of one week, from just over 11 000 cases last Friday to over 21 000 as of Thursday. 
Active cases refer to those people who are currently infected with the virus. It excludes the number of people who have died or recovered from the coronavirus. 
In the same period, deaths went from 87 in the province to 149 as of Thursday.
This as the country’s new infections have risen by over 21 000 cases since Monday (excluding Friday’s new infections tally which is yet to be announced). 
In the past seven days, 555 people have died from Covid-19 in South Africa - with Tuesday's 111 deaths being the deadliest day so far. 
In terms of infections, in the last seven days, 34 485 people have been infected with the virus - with the most cases being confirmed on Thursday, with over 6 500 confirmed in a single day. 
This also comes as President Cyril Ramaphosa last week further eased level 3 restrictions by allowing more sectors, including the personal care services, sit-in restaurants, casinos, cinemas and art galleries to reopen for the first time since March.

In Gauteng, active cases stood at 11810 and 87 deaths last Friday, and as of Thursday provincial deaths now stand at 149 and 21465 cases.
This indicates that Gauteng’s Covid-19 doubling rate is every six days currently.
As South Africa enters its Covid-19 peak, which is predicted as early as July in a worst-case scenario, or August, in the best-case scenario, infections are expected to rise.
