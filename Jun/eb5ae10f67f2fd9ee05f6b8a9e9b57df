Johannesburg - Internal processes would now be conducted by the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) following recommendations contained in an Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) report into the death of Collins Khosa. 

 

 Ipid said on Tuesday it had sent the report to the JMPD. The report recommends five JMPD officers and two SAPS officers should face disciplinary action for Khosa's death. 

 

 Khosa died in April following an altercation with SA National Defence Force (SANDF) members. It has been reported that Ipid's report had contained testimonies of witnesses who were present when the altercation took place. 

 

 Khosa's wife had maintained that Khosa was assaulted after SANDF members entered their residence in Alexandra and began arguing and proceeded to assault Khosa. She said his death was as a result of trauma caused by the beatings of SANDF members. 

 

 Witnesses told Ipid investigators they had seen the assault on Khosa, Two of the witnesses said they had also been assaulted by the soldiers after they were seen recording the incident. 

 

 Investigators were also told that JMPD officers stood by and watched as Khosa was assaulted. 
 Ipid has recommended the five JMPD officers should face disciplinary action along with the two SAPS officers. 

 

 JMPD's 
 Wayne Minnaar confirmed the unit had received Ipid's report. He said internal processes were under way through an investigation into the matter. 
 No action has been taken against the officers pending finalisation of internal processes, Minnaar said. 

 

 Last week, it emerged that an SANDF board inquiry into Khosa’s death and the SANDF member’s behaviour had found the members had not acted in a manner that led to Khosa’s death. 

 

 A criminal case on the matter is still pending.
