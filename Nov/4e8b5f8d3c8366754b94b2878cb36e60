Johannesburg - As the government prepares to expunge the criminal records of thousands of offenders, human rights activists have warned against the military-style policing that has resulted in 300 000 arrests during lockdown.“It is clear that of all the promises of 1994, there has been a collective failure to honour those rights-friendly promises, they are just rights on paper now,” said human rights activist Zonke Majodina, a former commissioner with the Human Rights Commission.She said it amounts to a miscarriage of justice when the very people entrusted with protecting the nation become perpetrators of abuse. While there have been examples of people breaking the law by transporting alcohol and cigarettes, as well as breaking curfews and a variety of other acts, many have been arrested while doing something as basic as shopping for their households or health reasons.In another incident, Mtwalume activist Hlengiwe Gambushe was charged with breaking lockdown regulations for organising a march on the KwaZulu-Natal South Coast after the murders of at least six women.Supported by civil society movement Right2Know Campaign, the charges against her were dropped after delays and several appearances in the Umzumbe Magistrates Court.“I’m relieved, it was not a good time,” she told the Sunday Independent yesterday.It was a case like this, which reflects the unreasonable nature of police restrictions on individuals, said Majodina, who is a member of several international human rights organisations. Under Covid-19, she said the restrictions on citizens’ rights should have been reasonable and justifiable but what has happened in South Africa, as well as countries, such as Kenya and Nigeria, where police use excessive force to violate peoples’ rights early in lockdown, amounted to an abuse of power.Majodina said the government is able to restrict freedom of movement, but within reason. But preventing someone from buying essential goods, like bread or medicine was wrong.“In the first two weeks of lockdown in April, people were arrested for just walking … worse, soldiers were seen parading with sjamboks, enforcing law, forcing people to do push ups and squats … this was so unnecessary and humiliating,” she said.“The deaths of Collins Khoza by Defence Force soldiers and 16-yearold Nathaniel Julies by police were completely unacceptable.“One can go further with the incident in which Khayelitsha resident Bulelani Qholani was dragged naked by Western Cape police in blatant disregard of his rights and dignity.”According to an Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) report to Parliament in May, apart from Khoza, another 11 South Africans died at the hands of police.“When you have a situation where people have lost their lives as a result, it is not only an abuse, it is illegal. Under our Constitution, everyone has the right to life. This is not negotiable.“Second, is the right to dignity. So when you murder, that is abuse of their powers by the very people who should be protecting these rights.”Majodina said there are rights and restrictions but within limits.“In our country, there are rights of arrested and detained people, they must be informed why they are being apprehended and told about the right to remain silent, not providing a confession, this may take place before the courts,” she said.Fixing the challenge is going to be a major problem. “It’s going to be a long journey because we have allowed a culture of entitlement to fester. When people were told that they have rights, they were not taught that it comes with responsibilities.“Government, citizens, private sector, we have all have taken this with impunity, especially among law enforcement and other agents of state with power over citizens, consequently the criminal justice system is riddled with a lack of procedures when it comes to doing their jobs, nobody is held accountable,” she said.Restoring respect for human rights and the rule of law, she said, therefore, is going to be difficult.Navi Pillay, a top South African jurist and former UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said: “Government tends to focus on image and has been in denial, but the track record is not great when one considers Marikana. Therefore, as society we need to be vigilant and cannot ignore what has happened.“Even under Covid-19 restrictions, it does not take away the right to protest, respect for elderly, and government actions should not amount to social exclusion,” she said, adding that the government finds itself in a painful conundrum, attempting to save lives while at the same time the law enforcement agencies meant to protect those rights were seemingly trampling on them.”Pillay said while prevention was critical, some of the lockdown measures, for example, arresting people who were walking on the beach, amounted to “over-reach”.An example of the laws depriving people of livelihood, she said was putting the brakes on fishermen during lockdown. “Initially, it was deemed a luxury according to the regulations, but it is a means of a livelihood for many,” said Pillay.Anshu Padayachee, chief executive of the South African Technology Network, said, “Covid-19 has tested the integrity, strength and preparedness of societies, governments, communities and individuals to deal with a pandemic, as a global community.”Padayachee said the sweeping powers exercised by President Cyril Ramaphosa and his executive team via the provisions of the Disaster Management Act in the initial stages of lockdown has tested South Africa’s constitutional democracy.“When such emergency powers are invoked, there is a clear risk of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms and disrespect for the rule of law,” she said.Alarmingly, it is the effect of lockdown regulations on ordinary citizens likely to have the most impact.Vishnu Naidoo, SAPS spokesperson, said 314 000 people were arrested during lockdown and the Justice Ministry was looking into categories of crime to determine what would happen.“Not all of the 314 000 individuals will have criminal records as some would have received warnings. When we arrest, we give warning, only those that appeared in court – between 150 000 to 200 000 individuals – would be affected,” he said.“If you have a case pending, it would impact; a record will only affect one if a country you destined for does not want you there. But I’m not sure if this category of crime will affect that, but for employment, it might, depending on how the company seeking an individual would view the crime committed.”The number of companies asking for clearance certificates for potential employees has increased – but for many, despite South Africa having the best human rights friendly laws on paper, the ruthless policing by the police and army during lockdown serve as harsh reminders of a brutal pandemic.* Edwin Naidu writes for the Wits Justice Project (WJP).
