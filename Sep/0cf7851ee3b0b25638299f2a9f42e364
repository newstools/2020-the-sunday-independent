Johannesburg - A Mpumalanga businessman who has been dead for almost a year yet was awarded R2 million personal protective equipment (PPE) tenders is among those being investigated by the provincial government.The Sunday Independent made the Mpumalanga government aware of the deals awarded to Tshepo Ngwenyama’s company a month ago, even though he is dead.Spokesperson for the Mpumalanga premier, Sibongile Mkani-Mpolweni, yesterday confirmed that Ngwenyama’s company, Thulatshepo General Trading, was being investigated.She said the investigation has been finalised but the report is still to be handed over to Premier Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane, who would then make it public.Ngwenyama’s father, Pilatu, confirmed to the Sunday Independent that his son passed away in October last year and that as a family knew nothing about the tenders that were awarded to his company.“Somebody must explain what is going on here. My son owned this company alone and he was single. He left behind children who are still very young to run a company. As his father, I know nothing about these contracts,” he said.The information seen by the Sunday Independent shows that a company owned by Ngwenyama, who died in a car accident, was awarded PPE tenders worth about R2m.The information was confirmed by the tender bulletin published by the provincial treasury. The tender bulletin which was confirmed to be authentic by Mkani-Mpolweni, showed that Ngwenyama’s company, Thulatshepo General Trading, had been awarded:* A R913 748 contract for a maintenance project as part of Covid-19 intervention at Shongwe Boarding School;* A R174 720 contract for a maintenance project as part of Covid-19 intervention at Camalaza Primary School;* A R139984 contract for a maintenance project as part of Covid-19 intervention at Mawewe Primary School;* R178 331 contract for a maintenance project as part of Covid 19 intervention at Mbambiso Secondary School;,* A R243 195 contract for a maintenance project as part of Covid 19 intervention at Nhanyane Primary School; and* A R40 264 contract for a maintenance project as part of Covid 19 intervention at Phakamani Primary School.Mkani-Mpolweni yesterday said the investigation has been concluded but said was shocked when informed that the owner is deceased.“What is needed now is that they brief the premier and she will then table it at an executive council then make it public,” she said.“I am not aware the owner is dead as we don’t deal directly with these companies or their owners.”Mkani-Mpolweni said the information on the tender bulletin “was abstracted from the BaaS (Blockchain-as-a-service) system in accordance with all payments that were made.“The information before you dates back from March to the date of disclosure by the premier.”Mtshweni-Tsipane said on August 19 that her province had spent more than R610m on PPE “expenditure”.The premier added that she had identified “a number of discrepancies related to the expenditure patterns and pricing in some departments and agencies”.“As a matter of urgency, I will be appointing an independent team of investigators that will be tasked with establishing reasons for the irregularities,” she said.The premier added that the departments where the discrepancies were noted included arts and culture, sports and recreation, provincial treasury, co-operative governance and traditional affairs as well as parks and tourism agency and the economic growth agency.“If there is prima facie (on the first impression) evidence of wrongdoing, we shall request the Special Investigating Unit to investigate further,” she added.Sunday Independent
