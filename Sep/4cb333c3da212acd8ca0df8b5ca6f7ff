Johannesburg - The country’s largest public sector union with 240 000 members has called for the removal of the UCT vice-chancellor (VC) Mamokgethi Phakeng, over her perceived silence on racism and sexism on campus - and the university’s slow transformation process under her watch.“We must mobilise our members at UCT to go for the head of this VC who opts to be silent on these issues,” said Busobengwe Magadla, the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) Ikapa South Regional Chair, who has accused Phakeng of stymying the progress of black African academics.He said had it not been for the lockdown restrictions, Nehawu would have already embarked on protest action against Phakeng, whom he referred to as a “puppet” for not championing black African academics.The Transformation Report 2019 raised concerns about people being silenced when they raised challenges around transformation and tells a different story from the “rosy narrative” presented.“We planned to picket as a build-up to something bigger, but level 2 lockdown regulations have prevented us from doing so. We will not leave any stone unturned in removing people who oppose transformation,” he said.Magadla said the VC was going on about a new concept of privilege “which really left us perplexed”. “How do you jump into privileges when the rights of young African professionals are being infringed in each and every corner of the institution? But we have taken a posture as a union that ‘whether you are black or pink, if you are standing in the way of transformation, we will crush you and get rid of you,” he said.He added that there was growing anger on campus over her silence following shocking claims of racism and bullying against UCT postgraduate students’ female surgeons, including several of the country’s first black registrars within traditionally white surgical divisions stationed at the world-renowned Groote Schuur Hospital. One of the cases involving a student, he said, was close to being resolved, even though she had ludicrously not been questioned by the university on her claims.“We aren’t for quantitative transformation but a qualitative one, so we are not going to postpone transformation any longer. It’s high time we expose and get rid of people opposed to transformation at UCT,” he said.A report by the ombud detailed 37 complaints of bullying against Phakeng.In March, one of the country’s top dermatologist’s, an African woman, was overlooked for the Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences role in favour of Associate Professor Lionel Green-Thompson.University spokesperson Elijah Moholola, said UCT’s recruitment processes are rigorous and thorough and the appointment processes are aligned with the national legislation, which recognises black Africans, Indians and coloured as part of the employment equity candidates. “The appointed candidate is a coloured male with extensive experience in the health sciences,” he said.On the threat by Nehawu, Moholola said UCT had always recognised protest action as an important exercise of democracy. “The UCT executive has equally always been open and willing to engage on multiple issues through a number of university channels,” he said.“UCT strongly rejects the allegations against the vice-chancellor,” he said, adding that the university recognises protest action as an important exercise of democracy.Moholola said since Phakeng took office in July 2018, of the 11 appointments made, eight are black, three are white with five female, and six males.According to a senior member of Phakeng’s executive, however, the claims against her are untrue. “Take for example the allegation that she (Phakeng) is anti-transformation, particularly when it comes to black women, the VC donates voluntarily 10% of her salary monthly for a scholarship particularly for black women.In addition, she has her own foundation that supports young girls.“Whenever she has speaking engagements, any money earned is for her foundation. She does not take any money personally. Her scholarship fund at UCT is supporting a number of black women postgraduate students.“When Covid struck, she donated a third of her salary to a Covid emergency fund for three months to help students in distress,” the staff member said.On September 1 in a statement, the Black Academic Caucus (BAC) called for an independent investigation into allegations of racism and sexism on campus and at the Groote Schuur Hospital.“This should be led by a credible panel of experts similar to the IRTC (Institutional Reconciliation and Transformation Commission set up after widespread tension on campus in 2016) and (Professor Bongani) Mayosi panels.We also call for UCT to fast-track the processing and finalisation of the anti-bullying policy as mentioned in the report of the Ombud,” the BAC said.The Commission on Gender Equality is investigating a complaint of racism at Groote Schuur and UCT.The Sunday Independent
