The University of Cape Town has responded to calls on Tuesday by the Black Academic Caucus for an independent investigation in allegations of racism and sexism on campus and at the Groote Schuur Hospital.In a statement, the university said it was working to transform the university and agreed that change was needed.The BAC said on Tuesday that it wants both the university and Groote Schuur hospital to launch an independent investigation into racism in all forms, as well as sexism, classism and unfair discrimination against black postgraduate students within the joint university-hospital space.“This should be led by a credible panel of experts similar to the IRTC (Institutional Reconciliation and Transformation Commission set up after widespread tension on campus in 2016) and (Professor Bongani) Mayosi panels. We also call for UCT to fast track the processing and finalization of the anti-bullying policy as mentioned in the recent report of the Ombud,” the BAC said in a statement.In response, the university said it agrees with the caucus that transforming UCT to reflect South Africa is essential. “Our commitment to achieving our transformation goals is foregrounded in our strategy for the future in our draft “Vision 2030” document that is currently being discussed. We also agree that wherever instances of racism or discrimination are identified they must be dealt with through the appropriate channels.”Concerning the issues raised by a postgraduate student in the Faculty of Health Sciences, the university said that faculty of health sciences dean Associate Professor Lionel-Green-Thompson is deeply involved in the matter and there is an extensive process underway to try to resolve the issues raised.The BAC said it read with deep sadness an article titled “Black doctors raise racism allegations”, that was published in the Sunday Independent on 23 August 2020.“The article paints a painful picture of a postgraduate student/employee who has suffered from unfair labour practices, racism and discrimination from colleagues and superiors, who are otherwise meant to be trainers and mentors, within the clinical and academic space. What was more shocking for us was learning that this matter had been raised with various authorities within the university and hospital; however, little or no action seems to have been taken to resolve this issue. We urge the powers that be, to investigate and deal with this issue transparently and fairly,” the statement said.The BAC calls for action comes amid growing pressure at UCT and Groote Schuur to address the racism and sexism claims by black doctors.Last week UCT’s head of the department of surgery at University of Cape Town Professor Graham Fieggen expressed “shame and regret” over the distressing allegations about racism and sexism claims under his watch. “I want to assure every member of the department that we are committed to abolishing all forms discriminatory conduct and removing all aspects of institutional culture that marginalise and disempower people,” he said in a letter to staff in the department which is part of the School of Adult Clinical Medicine in the faculty of health sciences.Fieggen was responding to reports which lifted the lid on racism against black medical doctors at Groote Schuur Hospital while the head of orthopaedic, the celebrated spinal surgeon Professor Robert Dunn, was criticized and is being probed for a crude email in which he used the term “clinic bitch” in a roster – which he said was a joke.Shocking claims of racism and bullying have emerged against UCT postgraduate students’ female surgeons, including several of the country’s first black registrars within traditionally white surgical divisions stationed at the world-renowned Groote Schuur Hospital. Ten out of 80 doctors are black – and many have been harassed or victimized without action from the Western Cape Provincial Government or UCT.The Commission on Gender Equality is investigating the racism and sexism claims at UCT and Groote Schuur Hospital while Busobengwe Magadla, the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union [Nehawu] Ikapa South Regional Chair, has called for action to address the main issues around the students exposed to racism which he said was not something new to the UCT community. “Even up to now, nothing has been done in respect of the remuneration of the postgraduate student which was unilaterally cut nor has she been allocated a mentor,” he said.The BAC said in its statement that racism seems to be a “perennial ghost” that is refusing exorcism in the fabric of South African society. “As the Black Academic Caucus, we have consistently not only called out overt racial incidents and discrimination within the university and society at large but also pointed to the subtle forms of racism that are pervasive in hidden assumptions and racist knowledges embedded in how we conduct our affairs at UCT.”The Caucus said it supports the intervention of Nehawu in the resolution of the labour-related aspect of this matter and expressed solidarity with the students and staff who continue to suffer racism and discrimination.
